# python-dev-task-summarization

The task has been done in two ways-
- Using pre-trained transformers model
- Using traditional Python libraries (without ML models)


## Using pre-trained transformers model
#### Web Scraping Tools: 
- ScrapperAPI
- BeautifulSoup
#### Paraphrasing Tools:
- used **"ramsrigouthamg/t5-large-paraphraser-diverse-high-quality"** pre-trained model from HuggingFace
#### Summarization Tools:
- used **/"google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail"/** pre-trained model from HuggingFace

## How to test or run this?
- Just open the **"Python_Dev_Task.ipynb"** file in Colab _or_ open this link: _https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wwaj0TobsnzQL5jMVsYrF5z6rc1944tE?usp=sharing_
- Run all the cell
